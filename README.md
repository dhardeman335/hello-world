# hello-world
My first repository

Hi! My name is Daniel Hardeman and I aspire to become a remote, full-stack web developer.  I love web development because it allows me to combine my love for both
artistic design and logic.  Additionally, I find the internet to be among the most
incredible creations in human history.  The internet connects us all and allows us to share information with eachother on a scale that can only be compared to a gigantic, world-wide mycelium network.  Individually, we are just single nodes in the network, but together, we form a body that contains all human knowledge.
